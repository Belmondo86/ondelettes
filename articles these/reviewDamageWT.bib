abstract = "This paper presents a general summary and review of state-of-the-art and development of vibration-based structural damage detection. Various structural damage detection methods based on structural dynamic characteristic parameters are summarised and evaluated. The principle of intelligent damage diagnosis and its application prospects in structural damage detection are introduced, and the development trends of structural damage detection are also put forward."
